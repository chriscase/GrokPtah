# Durable task runs

GrokPtah records Build turns as bounded durable runs under the bridge-owned
orchestration store. The desktop Tasks rail and the authenticated MCP control
plane read the same records.

## Lifecycle

```text
running -> completed
        -> failed
        -> cancelled
        -> limit_reached
        -> interrupted (only after a restart)
```

Each run records a stable run ID, session and workspace identity, a bounded
prompt preview, execution limits, journal sequence range, progress, changed
file summaries, recognized test observations, permission counts, token usage,
verification evidence, a bounded final response, and the terminal reason.

Build turns create a run before model work begins. Typed bridge events are
aggregated while the turn runs and reconciled from the journal at finalization.
The store atomically installs terminal records and marks queued or running
runs `interrupted` when it is reopened. An interrupted run is inspectable but
is never resumed automatically.

The desktop inspector is read-only for shared runs. Build sessions may opt into
strict isolated execution. An isolated run starts from a clean Git workspace in
a detached worktree below `.grokptah/worktrees/runs/`; the model writes only to
that worktree. A completed run records its final fingerprint and changed-file
summary as `ready` only after snapshot verification.

Promotion is deliberately explicit and review-gated:

1. Select `Isolated` for a Build session before starting a turn.
2. Open the Tasks rail and choose `Review diff` on a completed run.
3. Promote is enabled only while the review fingerprint still matches the
   durable run record.
4. Promotion checks that the original source workspace is unchanged, validates
   relative paths and symlink boundaries, applies the bounded Git patch, and
   verifies the final fingerprint. Repeating the same request is idempotent.
5. `Discard` removes only the managed run worktree. It never edits the source
   workspace.

Dirty source workspaces, source changes during execution, changed isolated
worktrees, protected metadata paths, and promotion conflicts fail closed. A
run cannot be promoted through the MCP surface yet; this slice intentionally
keeps that control desktop-only until the coordinator contract is extended.

## Privacy and bounds

- Desktop queries are scoped to one session ID.
- Prompt previews, handoffs, progress, and errors are truncated and redacted
  through the shared event bus before persistence.
- Run records do not store credentials, full prompts, full transcripts, or
  unrestricted terminal output.
- The existing journal, audit, idempotency, workspace allowlist, and MCP tool
  restrictions remain authoritative.
